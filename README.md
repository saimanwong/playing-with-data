# Playing with data

Just a repo to try out data science practices. ðŸ¤ž

## Plan

- [x] [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](0-kaggle-titanic), try to understand based on previous work.
- [ ] TBA, instead of looking into someone elses solution, try to pick a dataset and make sense of it using docs and wiki/blog articles.
- [ ] TBA, mine/scrape, store, manipulate, analyze and present the data.
