## Key learning takeaways

- Pandas, pandas, pandas 🐼
- Find correlation and manipulate data to fit algos (a lot of ifs/conditionals?)
- Supervised learning => desired output
- Try to implement algos from scratch to learn the theory behind them (maybe in Go?)
- Use GUI notebook with vim extension and use markdown to show the analysis (or just write cleaner code?)
- Try to tackle two more datasets. Then, come back and redo this one (should have learned a bit by then?)
